Hey! ðŸ‘‹

We've finally released [`auto-deploy-image`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image)
v1.0.0 that bundles `auto-deploy-app` Helm chart by default. This project still remains
only for patch releases for v0 charts, however, all feature implementaion
and breaking changes must be merged into the bundled chart in [`auto-deploy-image`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image).

As we got a new home to continue chart development,
this issue is moved to the [`auto-deploy-image`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image) project shortly.

If you have any questions, please ask in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/auto-deploy-app/-/issues/70>.
